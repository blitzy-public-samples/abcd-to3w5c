- Habit Service: Core habit management functionality
- Analytics Service: Data processing and insights
- Frontend: Progressive Web Application

### Data Flow

```mermaid

    A[Client] -->|HTTPS| B[API Gateway]
    B -->|JWT Auth| C[Auth Service]
    B -->|Habits| D[Habit Service]
    B -->|Analytics| E[Analytics Service]
    D -->|Data| F[(PostgreSQL)]
    D -->|Cache| G[(Redis)]
```

### Security

- JWT-based authorization
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Regular security audits and updates

### Scalability

- Horizontal scaling via Kubernetes
- Database replication and sharding
